## IN this repository, I have created a StringManipulator java class, that will be performing the following operations:

(a) A method named as reverseString which will take String as input and reverse it,

(b) A method named as findDuplicates which will take an array of integers and returs the collection of duplicate numbers,

(c) A method named as countVowel, which will return the number of vowels in the string provided earlier as input.

## This repository has two branches:

(a) feature/development
(b) feature/enhancement

## You can run the Java class on your system:

(a) By cloning this repository,
(b) Navigating to the cloned repository using cd Path/to/the/Java/File
(c) And typing the command "java filename"

Note: Make sure you have JAVA (JDK) pre-installed on your system along with its environment variable path setup
